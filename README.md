This is a python package for detecting copy-move attack on a digital image.

This project is part of our paper that [has been published at Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-73689-7_39). More detailed theories and steps are explained there.

The project is formerly written with Python 2 for our Undergraduate Thesis, which is now left unmaintained [here](https://github.com/rahmatnazali/image-copy-move-detection-python2). The original thesis is written in Indonesian that in any case can also be downloaded from [here](http://repository.its.ac.id/1801/).

## Description
The implementation generally manipulates overlapping blocks, and are constructed based on two algorithms:
1. Duplication detection algorithm, taken from [Exposing Digital Forgeries by Detecting Duplicated Image Region](http://www.ists.dartmouth.edu/library/102.pdf) ([alternative link](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Exposing-Digital-Forgeries-by-Detecting-Duplicated-Popescu-Farid/b888c1b19014fe5663fd47703edbcb1d6e4124ab)); Fast and smooth attack detection algorithm on digital image using [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), but sensitive to noise and any following manipulations that are being applied after the attack phase (in which they call it _post region duplication process_)
2. Robust detection algorithm, taken from [Robust Detection of Region-Duplication Forgery in Digital Image](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1699948); Relatively slower process with rough result on the detection edge but are considered robust towards noise and _post region duplication process_

### How do we modify them?

We know that the first algorithm use `coordinate` and `principal_component` features, while the second algorithm use `coordinate` and `seven_features`.

Knowing that, we then attempt to give a tolerance by merging all the features like so:

![Modification diagram](assets/modification_diagram.PNG?raw=true) 

The attributes are saved as one object. Then a lexicographical sorting is applied to the principal component and the seven features.

The principal component will bring similar block closer, while the seven features will back up the detection for a block that can't be detected by principal component due to being applied with post region duplication process (for example being blurred).

By doing so, the new algorithm will have a tolerance regarding variety of the input image. The detection result will be relatively smooth and accurate for any type of image, with a trade-off in run time as we basically run two algorithm.

## Using the package

To install the package, simply hit it with pip: `pip3 install pimage`

### API for the detection process

- The API for detection process is provided via `copy_move.detect(image_path, block_size)` method. 
- Determining the `block_size`: The first algorithm use block size of `32` pixels so this package will use the same value by default. Increasing the size means faster run time at a reduced accuracy. Analogically, decreasing the size means longer run time with increased accuracy.

For example:

```python3
from pimage import copy_move

fraud_list, ground_truth_image, result_image = copy_move.detect("dataset_example_blur.png", block_size=32)
```

- `fraud_list` will be the list of `(x_coordinate, y_coordinate)` of the blocks group and the total number of the blocks it is formed with. If this list is not empty, we can assume that the image is being tampered. For example:
    ```
    ((-57, -123), 2178)
    ((-11, 140), 2178)
    ((-280, 114), 2178)
    ((-34, -305), 2178)
    ((-37, 148), 2178)
    ```
  the above output means there are 5 possible matched/identical region with 2178 overlapping blocks on each of it
- `ground_truth_image` contains the black and white ground truth of the detection result. This is useful for comparing accuracy, MSE, etc with the ground truth from the dataset
- `result_image` is the given image where the possible fraud region will be color-bordered (if any)

`ground_truth_image` and `result_image` will be formatted as `numpy.ndarray`. It can further be processed as needed. For example, it can be programmatically modified and then exported later as image like so:

```python
import imageio

imageio.imwrite("result_image.png", result_image)
imageio.imwrite("ground_truth_image.png", ground_truth_image)
```

### Quick command to detect an image

To quickly run the detection command for your image, the `copy_move.detect_and_export()` is also provided. The command is identical with `.detect()` but it also save the result to desired output path.

```python
from pimage import copy_move

copy_move.detect_and_export('dataset_example_blur.png', 'output', block_size=32)
```

this code will save the `ground_truth_image` and `result_image` inside `output` folder.

## Verbose mode

When running `copy_move.detect()` or `copy_move.detect_and_export()`, you can pass `verbose=True` to output 
the status of each step. The default value will be `False` so nothing will be printed.

Example output when verbose mode is being enabled:

## Example image

All the result of the dataset should be inside `output` directory of this repository.

The image shown is ordered as: original, attacked, and the resulting detection image.
